class Solution {
    public int distanceTraveled(int mt, int at) {
        Since the loop includes 2 variables namely mt which is decreasing by 5 and at which is decreasing by 1, the overall time complexity of the code will be O(at) or roughly O(n).
        int distance=mt; 
        int count=0; 
        while((mt>=5) && (at>=1)){ 
            mt=mt-5;
            count++;
            at--;
            mt++;
        }
        int ans=(distance+count)*10;
        return ans;
        }
    }
